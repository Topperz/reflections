Using diff to display the changes between versions, is a very fast way to zoom in on what has caused the bug.

Having acces to all versions of a file, will allow me to revert back if something breaks, but also highlight when unnessesary code was written.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Full control over the logic behind the commits.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is build specifically for coding. It is important to snapshot a version of the entire project.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log can be used to browse when a version vas committed. git diff can compare versions to view changes.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Security that everything is backed up to a working checkpoint.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Some kind of version control?? !!
