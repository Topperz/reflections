What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the initial git files, so you can start commiting versions.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It works as a temporary workspace for files that needs to be commited. It helps to eliminate unnessesary commits.
